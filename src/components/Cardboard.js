        <p className="paragraph1">Championing the recycling and repurposing of cardboard is a noble endeavor that unfolds a tale of environmental stewardship. Each folded box given a second life not only lessens our ecological footprint but also crafts a narrative of responsible living. By infusing discarded cardboard with purpose, we contribute to a vibrant cycle of sustainability, breathing vitality into our planet. Embracing this mindful approach isn't just an act; it's a celebration of conscientious choices that resonate far beyond our immediate surroundings, fostering a brighter, more harmonious world for generations to come<br/></p>

When theyâ€™re finished, no one will ever know that they used to be empty cardboard boxes. <br/><br/></p>
     <p className='paragraph1' ><b>Materials Needed</b>:<br/><br/>
     <b>1.</b> 3 square boxes (sizes: 14 inch, 12 inch, and 10 inch)<br/>
     <b>2.</b> 3 colors of fabric (The 10 inch and 12 inch box need 2 yards of fabric each, and the 14 inch box needs 3 yards)<br/>
     <b>3.</b> Spray Adhesive<br/>
     <b>4.</b> 3 Old elts <br/>
     <b>5.</b> Screw Bolts<br/>
     <b>6.</b> Gold Paint Pen <br/><br/>

     <b>Steps:</b><br/>
     <b>1. </b>Measure out a rectangle that is 26 inches x 42 1/2 inches and cut it.<br/><br/>
     <b>2. </b>Now fold over 1 inch of the longer horizontal side that is 42 1/2 inches, and crease by ironing it while folded.<br/><br/>
     <b>3. </b>Now, with the longer side still laid out horizontally, place the box in the middle with the open side facing away from you. Use a ruler to place it 5 inches from the bottom of the fabric.<br/><br/>
     <b>4. </b>Apply spray adhesive to the right side and the top and wrap the fabric fairly tight and smooth out any air bubbles with your hands.<br/><br/>
     <b>5. </b>Roll the box 180 degrees to the left so the side that was facing up is now facing down.<br/><br/>
     <b>6. </b>Spray the left side and what is now the top with the spray adhesive and wrap the fabric around it as well. <br/><br/>
     <b>7. </b>Hold the belt in place where you want it to end up and then cut it <br/><br/>
     <b>8. </b>Mark 1 inch from the top of the open side of the box where you want the belt to be attached <br/><br/>
     <b>9. </b> Use a drill to drill a hole in the box on your mark. Then drill a hole in the belt. Attach the belt using the screw bolts.<br/><br/>
     <b>10. </b> Paint the screw bolts with the gold paint pen. This unifies the design and completes the look.<br/><br/>

      Believe it or not, cardboard can serve as an excellent planter, its porous nature allows for proper aeration and drainage, creating an ideal environment for plant growth. Although, not all plants thrive in cardboard planters, certain varieties, such as herbs and shallow-rooted vegetables, benefit from the moisture retention and insulation that cardboard provides.
      Here, are a few tips to make these.
      </p><br/>
     
     <p className='paragraph1' >
     {/* <b>1.</b> A transparent glass jar or vase with a lid or cork<br/>
     <b>2.</b> Cotton rope, felt, or other absorbent materials<br/>
     <b>3.</b> Choose plants that thrive in your environment and suit the size of the glass container.<br/>
     <b>4.</b> Another smaller glass container or plastic bottle<br/>
     <br/> */}
     <b>Steps:</b><br/><br/>

     <b>1. </b>Decorate a simple cardboard box with different colors of paints, stickers etc. <br/><br/>
     <b>2. </b>To prevent waterlogging, make small drainage holes at the bottom of the planter. This can be done by punching or cutting small openings.<br/><br/>
      <b>3. </b>Attach a waterproof lining (plastic sheet) inside the cardboard planter to protect it from moisture. Use strong adhesive or tape to secure the lining in place.<br/><br/>
      <b>4. </b> Fold along the cut edges to assemble the planter. Apply adhesive to secure the edges. Fill the planter with soil and plant your favorite flowers or herbs.<br/>
