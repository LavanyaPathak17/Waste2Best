      <div className='one'>
        <p className="paragraph1">Jute sacks, also known as burlap bags, are versatile and durable packaging materials made from natural jute fibers. Renowned for their strength and biodegradability, jute sacks are commonly used for storing and transporting a variety of goods such as grains, coffee beans, and potatoes. Their eco-friendly nature makes them an ideal choice for sustainable packaging solutions, offering breathability and moisture resistance while reducing reliance on synthetic materials. Additionally, jute sacks are often repurposed into reusable shopping bags, home decor items, and compostable planters, further extending their lifespan and minimizing waste. With their renewable source and minimal environmental impact, jute sacks play a crucial role in promoting environmentally conscious practices across industries and households alike.<br/></p>

      />
     <p className='paragraph1' >
     <b>Steps:</b><br/>

     <b>1.</b>Measure and mark rectangles on the jute sacks using the ruler and pencil or pen. A typical bookmark size is around 2 inches by 6 inches (5 cm by 15 cm), but you can adjust based on your preference.<br/><br/>
     <b>2.</b>Carefully cut out the rectangles along the marked lines using scissors. If desired, decorate the jute rectangles with beads, buttons, or other decorative elements. You can sew them on or attach them with fabric glue. <br/><br/>
      <b>3.</b>Fold the jute rectangle in half lengthwise, with the decorated side facing inward. Trim the corners of the folded end to create a neat tapered edge.<br/><br/>
      <b>4.</b>You can hand-sew the edges using a needle and thread.<br/><br/>
      <b>5.</b>Once the glue is dry or the edges are sewn, your jute bookmark is ready to use!
Optionally, you can further personalize the bookmark by adding embroidery, stamping, or painting designs on it.<br/><br/>
      <b>6.</b>If using electrical components, test the lights to ensure they are working properly before finalizing the structure.<br/><br/>
      <b>7.</b>If you used fabric glue, allow the bookmark to dry completely before using it to avoid any sticking.<br/><br/>
      <b>8.</b>Use your handmade jute bookmark to mark your place in books, journals, or planners, and feel good about repurposing materials in a sustainable way.<br/><br/>
